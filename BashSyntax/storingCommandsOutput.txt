In Bash scripting, the syntax variable=$(command) is used for command substitution. This means that the output of the command inside the parentheses is assigned to the variable. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate this:

#!/bin/bash

# Assign the output of the 'date' command to the variable 'current_date'
current_date=$(date)

# Print the value of 'current_date'
echo "The current date and time is: $current_date"
