The #!/bin/bash line at the beginning of a script is known as a shebang or hashbang. 
While it looks like a comment, it serves a crucial purpose:

Purpose of Shebang
	1. Specifies the Interpreter: The shebang tells the operating system which interpreter 
           to use to execute the script. In this case, /bin/bash specifies that the script should 
           be run using the Bash shell. This is important because different shells (like sh, zsh, ksh) 
           have different features and syntax.

	2. Portability: Including the shebang makes your script more portable. If you move the script 
           to another system, the shebang ensures it uses the correct interpreter, avoiding potential 
           errors or unexpected behavior.

	3. Convenience: When you run the script directly from the command line (e.g., ./script.sh), 
           the shebang allows the system to automatically use the specified interpreter without needing 
           to type "bash script.sh"

Example-------
Hereâ€™s a simple script with a shebang:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"

Without the shebang, you would need to explicitly call the interpreter:

"bash script.sh"
--------------

Including the shebang makes it easier to execute the script directly and 
ensures it runs as intended across different environments
